# Variables and Operators

This project is part of the *Zero to Hero* tutorial series for Dart and Flutter by Robert Mollentze.

## Homework Questions:

1. What are variables?
2. What is the default value of all variables and objects?
3. What's the key difference between **num** and **int** and **double**?
4. What's the key difference between **var** and **dynamic**?
5. What's the key difference between **const** and **final**?
6. List the range of values for the following variables?
- **bool**
- **Null**
- **double**
- **int**
7. What is the **late** keyword used for?
8. What's the difference between --c and c--?
9. Describe the following operators and provide an example of how they're used:
- %
- ~/=
- ^
- ! (2 uses)
- ? (2 uses)
- ??
10. Provide an example of how the following types are converted:
- **int** to **double**
- **double** to **int**
- **String** to **int**
- **String** to **double**
- **num** to **double**
- **double** to **num**
- **bool** to **String**
- **String** to **bool**
11. When checking for types, the difference between using the keyword **is** vs. the method *.runtimeType()?*
12. What's the point of Null safety?
13. What are bitwise operators?
14. When should we define variables explicitly/implicitly?
15. What is **typedef** used for?
16. Write an expression that evaluates to either "POSITIVE" or "NEGATIVE" depending on whether the variable "a" is positive or negative. Write the expression (1) using an if statement and (2) using a conditional statement.
17. When should we use if statements and when should we use conditional statements?
